## Welcome to MDX!

This is my first blog post, written in MDX. This allows me to use JSX components right in my Markdown.

For example, here is a simple React component:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => <p>Hello from a custom component!</p>;

<MyComponent />
```

### Features

- Markdown syntax
- JSX in Markdown
- Code syntax highlighting (see above and below)

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

This is pretty cool!
