## The Power of Prose

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is fantastic for styling blocks of text content, like this blog post. It applies sensible defaults to headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Sensible Defaults**: Out-of-the-box styling that looks great.
2.  **Customizable**: Easily extendable via your `tailwind.config.js`.
3.  **Dark Mode Support**: Works well with dark themes using `prose-invert`.

Here's an example of a table styled with GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown), which `remark-gfm` should handle:

| Feature         | Status      | Notes                           |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Basic Styling   | Implemented | Paragraphs, headings, etc.      |
| Code Blocks     | ImDENIED    | With `rehype-highlight`       |
| GFM Tables      | Supported   | Thanks to `remark-gfm`          |
| Dark Mode       | Supported   | Using `dark:prose-invert`       |

```python
# This is a python code block
def my_function():
  print("Syntax highlighting should work here!")

my_function()
```

Remember to install and configure these tools for the best experience!
